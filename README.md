## Why did I build CampaignCritic?
I built CampaignCritic because of three reasons:
- I've used Kickstarter many times in the past and unfortunately, I've run into quite a few campaigns that had a brilliant product or service, but crippled by a poorly designed project description. If only they had spent some time thinking about the pitch, they would've had more success in their campaign. 
- I'm a huge fan of the crowdfunding world&mdash;it enables everyday folks to become entrepreneurs and sometimes, gives rise to a revolutionary new genre of [products](https://www.pebble.com/)
- Human language is the most unstructured type of data, and yet we effortlessly parse and interpret it&mdash;even generating our own. On the other hand, decoding and understanding everyday language is a significant challenge for machines. That's why I'm so passionate about natural language processing and master it in my career as a data scientist. In this project, I wanted to showcase how some aspects of NLP can be utilized to unlock the secrets of designing a great campaign for Kickstarter. However, my hope is that we can someday utilize NLP and machine learning to build an AI that can do this for us, and not just Kickstarter but perhaps business plans for new companies as well, leading to more frequent innovations in the future.
