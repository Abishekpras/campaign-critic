## What is CampaignCritic?
A web app that helps Kickstarter creators increase their chances of reaching the campaign's funding goal by analyzing the project description, its structure and content.

## How do you use CampaignCritic?
If you've recently launched a Kickstarter, visit the [app](http://campaigncritic.com/) and add the URL to your project. If you're still drafting your campaign, the preview URL should work too. After you submit your project link, you'll receive 3 pieces of information:
1. The probability that your project will reach its funding goal
2. How to improve your chances by tweaking 6 structural components of your project's description
3. How to improve your chances by adding specific language or topics that are highly predictive of successfully funded projects

## How does CampaignCritic work?

## Why did I build CampaignCritic?
1. I want to help Kickstarter creators maximize their chances of reaching their funding goal. Too many innovative projects are crippled by a lackluster project description.
2. I'm a big fan of the crowdfunding world&mdash;it enables everyday folks to become entrepreneurs and sometimes even gives rise to a revolutionary new genre of [products](https://www.pebble.com/).
3. I love natural language processing and want to use it to build tools that enable machines to decode and interpret the most unstructured data of all&mdash;human language. By doing so, perhaps we'll someday teach a machine to design Kickstarter campaigns, or even business plans for new companies as well.
