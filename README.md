## Why did I build CampaignCritic?
I built CampaignCritic because:
1. I want to help Kickstarter creators maximize their chances of reaching their funding goal. Too many innovative projects are crippled by a lackluster project description.
2. I'm a big fan of the crowdfunding world&mdash;it enables everyday folks to become entrepreneurs and sometimes even gives rise to a revolutionary new genre of [products](https://www.pebble.com/).
3. I love natural language processing and want to use it to build tools that enable machines to decode and interpret the most unstructured data of all&mdash;human language. By doing so, perhaps we'll someday teach a machine to design Kickstarter campaigns, or even business plans for new companies as well.
