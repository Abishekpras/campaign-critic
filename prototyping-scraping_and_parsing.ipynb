       "\"I am a 51 year old woman who was a general manager for restaurants for years. I moved to Florida 3 years ago and found unemployment at 11%. Without being able to find a good job I started my own business as a house cleaner. I have been very successful cleaning two houses a day during season (or city rely's on snowbirds) and right now there is little work. House cleaning is a very hard physical job, that I like, but I don't love. And I'm finding that my body only has a few more years left to be doing this kind of work. What will I do, when I can't do this anymore?????? So I sat down and started listing the things that I love. And my list kept coming back to. I love to bake! After sitting down and making a business plan, if I could get kickstarted with a few thousand dollars I could rent a small space and equip it with what I need. It would help me with licensing and insurance. And if anything was left I could get a professional website done, and have a strong base to give my last try at making it....a go! This is my last dream, hope you can help me get to 70! Thank you, Barbara\""
